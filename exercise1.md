I'll discuss CI/CD and development tools for Python. For linting we have couple of options, but the most popular one is the pylint tool. It enforces both logical and stylistic rules. pylint can be installed directly into vs code as an extension, making it run as we write our code, which makes development process easier and convenient.  There are no shortage of testing tools either. Python even comes with testing library pre-installed, it's called "PyUnit/UnitTest", meaning we don't have to install any additional libraries unless necessary.
Other than Jenkins and GitHub Actions GitLab, Travis and TeamCity seem to be popular among developers. Travis automates the process of software testing and deployment, it is an open source project and can be integrated into GitHub projects. Travis CI is one of the leading tools on the market with customers like Facebook, Twitter and others. Travis is free and easy to use. TeamCity is a JetBrain's Continuous integration tool it supports .net, python and other languages through plugins. TeamCity has both free and paid versions. 
Many Ci/CD tools offer self-hosting (both Travis CI and GitLab have self-hosting options) and cloud-based services. This completely depends on the size of the project. If we are building a small or even medium sized application i think cloud-based services would be better as they are easier to set-up and use. On the other hand self-hosting ci/cd development tools are good for large projects where we usually need more space.
